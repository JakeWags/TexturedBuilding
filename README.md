# Textured Building

This is a client-side code mod for Vintage Story. Textured building adds a mode, "random mode" to randomly select a block on your entire hotbar when building. This allows for very easy texturing when building.

## Activating

To toggle "random mode", simply press R. A message will pop up in your chat indicating whether or not random mode is enabled.
